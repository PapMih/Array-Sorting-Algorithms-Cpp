# Array-Sorting-Algorithms-Cpp
This project was developed as part of the C++ programming seminars in the MSc in Control and Computing at the University of Athens.
It is a console-based application written in C++ that dynamically allocates memory and sorts arrays of different data types â€” integers, real numbers, characters, and strings.
The user selects the type of array and one of three available sorting methods (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort).
The program then allocates memory accordingly, accepts input values, performs the selected sorting process, and displays the results before and after sorting.
